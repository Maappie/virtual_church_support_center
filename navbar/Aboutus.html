            The history of San Miguel de Manila, possibly the first parish in
            the Philippines dedicated to the Archangel, spans centuries of
            transformation and resilience. Established in the 1620s in Dilao,
            east of Intramuros, it was initially a Jesuit effort to unite
            Japanese immigrants in their own quarter. The church's construction
            and relocation, recounted in accounts from the time, reflect the
            tumultuous relations between Manila and Japan. Over the years,
            jurisdictional disputes arose between the Franciscan and Jesuit
            orders regarding ministering to the Japanese settlers. The parish
            saw various calamities, including plagues, earthquakes, and fires,
            yet it endured.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1768, the expulsion of the Jesuits left San Miguel without
            pastors, leading to its attachment to other parishes until
            eventually falling under Franciscan care. Catastrophes like the
            great fire of 1778 prompted the parish's relocation across the Pasig
            River. Reconstruction efforts and renovations followed, often
            financed by patrons like the Roxas de Ayalas

            San Miguel's significance grew, becoming a district of Manila and
            serving as the Pro-cathedral after the inauguration of the Republic
            in 1946. The church witnessed notable events in Philippine history,
            such as the elevation of Archbishop Vicente Reyes to the episcopate.
            It remained a focal point for society events, including weddings and
            ceremonies, attracting prominent figures like President Carlos P.
            Garcia.

            Despite political upheavals, including Martial Law under Marcos, the
            parish persisted, adapting to challenges. Msgr. Josefino Ramirez
            introduced street masses to reach out to communities. His vision for
            San Miguel as a National Shrine dedicated to St. Michael and the
            Archangels came to fruition in 1986, coinciding with the EDSA
            Revolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            The consecration of the church as the National Shrine marked a new
            chapter, symbolizing resilience, faith, and community amidst
            historical and social change.
