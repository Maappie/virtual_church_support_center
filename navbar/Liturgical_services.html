            The "Holy Sacrament of Confirmation" refers to the sacrament of
            Confirmation in the Catholic Church, particularly in Filipino
            culture. In the sacrament of Confirmation, baptized individuals are
            strengthened by the Holy Spirit through the laying on of hands by a
            bishop or priest, and they receive the gifts of the Holy Spirit.
            This sacrament is considered one of the three sacraments of
            initiation, along with Baptism and Eucharist, completing the grace
            of Baptism.

            In the Philippines, the term "Kumpil" is often used to refer to
            Confirmation, especially in colloquial language. It's an important
            rite of passage for Catholic individuals, typically occurring during
            adolescence, where they affirm and deepen their commitment to the
            Catholic faith.

            "Pamisa" is a Filipino term that refers to a Mass or a religious
            service, particularly in the context of commemorating or praying for
            the souls of the departed. It's often associated with the Catholic
            tradition in the Philippines, where families or communities hold
            Masses for deceased loved ones, especially during anniversaries of
            their passing or during special occasions like All Souls' Day.
          </p>
          <p>
            The term "pamisa" is derived from the Spanish word "misa," which
            means Mass. In the Philippine context, it may also be referred to as
            "pa-misa" or "pa-siyam," particularly when a series of nine Masses
            are offered for the deceased, known as a novena. These Masses are
            seen as a way to pray for the souls of the departed and to offer
            comfort and support to their families.
